# SequenceMediaDownloader

A simple C# tool to download from a list of URLs at once.

How to use:

Step 1: Create a folder with the path `C:\Users\UserName\Desktop\dess\`

Step 2: Create a txt file with the name `C:\Users\UserName\Desktop\link.txt`, then paste the desired links into it.

Step 3: Run `Program.cs` and Enjoy

Note that the name of the path and text file can be changed as you like, you just need to change it yourself in the code because I'm very lazy to add more features now. Happy coding lol.

Step 4: You may change the Regex, and/or the `ParseLink()` method in `Parser.cs` for filtering the URL(s). It also gives ability to name the files as you like.

--> Change the code as you would like, your coding skill is the power ğŸ˜‰
